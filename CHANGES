1.0.2:

Thu Nov 23 1:41:00 PDT 2006 / Ben Pfaff <blp@cs.stanford.edu>

- Fix version number reported by fm and fmscan programs, as well as
  the version number included in the manpages.

  Bug report by "Petr Slansky" <slansky@usa.net>.

- No functional changes.

1.0.1:

Sat Oct 7 1:05:00 PDT 2006 / Ben Pfaff <blp@cs.stanford.edu>

- Make fm able to sleep for a user-specified time, or forever, after
  applying settings.  This makes fm usable with radio tuner drivers
  that turn off the radio after the fd used for tuning is closed.

  Idea and patch from Dave Ulrick <d-ulrick@insightbb.com>.

1.0:

Sat Sep 3 12:21:00 PDT 2004 / Ben Pfaff <blp@cs.stanford.edu>

- New maintainer.  New home page is http://benpfaff.org/fmtools

- Updated email addresses.

- Integrated Debian packaging.

- Made fmscan threshold configurable from command line.

- Use videodev.h header detached from kernel to avoid including kernel
  headers.

0.99.1:

Fri Aug 16 23:08:30 CDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - fm, fmscan: fix the FSF's address in the headers

Fri Aug 16 23:07:49 CDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - COPYING: put in the modern version of the GPL v2, with the correct
   address for the FSF.

Fri Aug 16 23:05:33 CDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - Makefile: reworked a bunch of stuff, and added such useful things
   like install targets.  Hopefully this will make packaging less of 
   a hack.

Fri Aug 16 22:55:41 CDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - fm: do the VIDIOCGAUDIO first so there's always good data in the struct

Fri Aug 16 22:48:10 CDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - fm.1: incorporated the man page written by Ben Pfaff.

Fri Aug 16 22:47:01 CDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - fm: set va.balance to 32768 rather than relying on whatever junk
   happens to be in the struct.   Reported by ahmet inan.

Fri Aug 16 22:43:47 CDT 2002 / Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - fm: applied patch from Viktor Rosenfeld to fix the rounding so that
   channels like 99.95 MHz can be tuned.

0.99.0:

Sat Feb  3 22:41:12 CST 2001 - Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - Final cleanups for 0.99.0.  This source has been sitting around for
   awhile, so it's probably time to push towards 1.0 and call it done.
   How much can you do to a pair of radio programs, anyway?

Thu Jan  4 17:29:49 CST 2001 - Russell Kroll <rkroll@exploits.org>

 - fmscan: ioctl/code cleanups, ala fm
 - fmscan: -d <dev> support
 - fm: -d <dev> support for multiple devices (/dev/radio1 and so on)
 - fm: ioctl results checked, other coding cleanups
