.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fmscan
is a program to scan a frequency band for radio stations, using the
video4linux interface introduced in 2.1.x series Linux kernels.  It
shows which ones have a accumulated signal strength of 50% or higher.
This process can take a while, and results vary greatly depending on the
radio card in use.
.SS OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.B \-h
Print a usage message to standard output, and exit.
.TP
\fB\-d \fIdevice
Sets \fIdevice\fR as the device to tune.  The default is
\fB/dev/radio0\fR.
.TP
\fB\-s \fIfreq
Starting frequency for scan, in MHz.  Default: 87.9.
.TP
\fB\-e \fIfreq
Ending frequency for scan, in MHz.  Default: 107.9.
.TP
\fB\-i \fIfreq
Increment between scanned channels, in MHz.  Default: 0.2.
.SH BUGS
This program may not do much if your radio card's driver doesn't support
fine tuning in 1/16000 MHz offsets.  By default, v4l assumes 1/16 MHz
tuning units, which introduces evil rounding errors on many frequencies.
If in doubt, grep for VIDEO_TUNER_LOW in your driver's source.
.PP
Supports only tuner 0 on any given device.
